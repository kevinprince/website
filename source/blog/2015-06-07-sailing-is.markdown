The past week has been fun, frustrating and but ultimately some times things
are just not supposed to workout when your aboard the good ship SV Ellipsis.

We achieved a few things however

- Ellipsis is now less hippy and more flammable thanks to new petrol engines
- We enjoyed the wonders of the Devon and Cornwall's famed hospitality again
- Installed a hammock
- Attempted to go sailing but decided being sick for a 30 hour passage
was a rubbish idea.

While its a shame to not have made it to the land of wine and cheese, I am
instead heading to Wales for a few days to make new plans.

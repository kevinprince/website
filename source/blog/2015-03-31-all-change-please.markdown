It’s been almost four years since I joined The Lab at O2. During that time I have worked with amazing people and work on some great projects including “O2 Connect” which went on to be the building blocks for TuGo, O2 MatchDay which end up with a national newspaper campaign and due to a joke at my initial interviews got to run HACKED at the O2 for over 500 people.

Over the last few months I have been thinking what’s next and decided something’s:

- Escape London (I love this city but we need a little break)
- Learn new things which are not just coding the latest thing
- Fix my five+ year old shoulder injury

So last week on my thirtieth birthday I quit my job at O2, handed the notice in on my flat and in early June will be heading off for a few weeks sailing followed by some kind of epic adventure involving South East Asia and Canada.

At some point I will need to think about work again so if you think you have something interesting or would like some freelance consulting please get in touch!

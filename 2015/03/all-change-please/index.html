      <h6>Posted on March 31, 2015</h6>
      <p>It’s been almost four years since I joined The Lab at O2. During that time I have worked with amazing people and work on some great projects including “O2 Connect” which went on to be the building blocks for TuGo, O2 MatchDay which end up with a national newspaper campaign and due to a joke at my initial interviews got to run HACKED at the O2 for over 500 people.</p>

<p>Over the last few months I have been thinking what’s next and decided something’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Escape London (I love this city but we need a little break)</li>
  <li>Learn new things which are not just coding the latest thing</li>
  <li>Fix my five+ year old shoulder injury</li>
</ul>

<p>So last week on my thirtieth birthday I quit my job at O2, handed the notice in on my flat and in early June will be heading off for a few weeks sailing followed by some kind of epic adventure involving South East Asia and Canada.</p>

<p>At some point I will need to think about work again so if you think you have something interesting or would like some freelance consulting please get in touch!</p>
